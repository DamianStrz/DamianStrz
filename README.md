- 👋 Hi, my name is Damian.
- 👀 I’m searching for posibilities to develop my skills at JavaScript, React, WebDesign (newbie). 
I'm also interested in music, learning new things and I like to share my knowledge to other people.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and React mostly.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that helps me get more knowledge, choose specialisation and experience, but also 
wil give positive feeling about working on it and satisfaction after my tasks are done.
- 📫 How to reach me: damian.strzalkowski@o2.pl.
